# Introduction to Programming Languages CECS130
## Lab 3
### Programming assignment (100 pts): Write a computer program in C which will simulate a calculator. Your calculator needs to support the five basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus) plus primality testing (natural number is prime if it has no non-trivial divisors). Example of the output follows:

#### Calculator Menu:
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
  5. Modulus (integers only)
  6. Test if prime (integers only)
  7. Exit  
Please choose an operation: 2  
Enter the first number: 18  
Enter the second number: 20  
18 â€“ 20 = -2  

#### Calculator Menu:
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
  5. Modulus (integers only)
  6. Test if prime (integers only)
  7. Exit
Please choose an operation: 6  
Enter the number to be tested: 22  
Not prime: 2 x 11 = 22  

#### Calculator Menu:
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
  5. Modulus (integers only)
  6. Test if prime (integers only)
  7. Exit  
Please choose an operation: 7  
Good Bye!  


You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author information, program description, lab section, date, etc.)
